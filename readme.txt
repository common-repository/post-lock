Post Lock prevents accidental updating or publishing of content by requiring a password to do either.

* Adds a layer of protection without adding a headache: unlocking a post is a seamless experience and takes a few seconds.
* Works on all post types (you can easily exclude or include post types with a plugin filter).
* Simple, solid code.
* If a post is unlocked, and two beats of the WordPress Heartbeat API happen without action (which is usally 30 seconds, 15 per beat), then the post is re-locked.
* Numerous plugin filters make it easy to customize the plugin.

== Installation ==

Upload the Post Lock plugin to your blog, activate it, and rejoice.
